## Scope of Task 1

- **Onboarding scenarios**: Define how ecosystem participants (TSPs, Wallet Providers, RPs, CAs) are registered, validated, and brought under the trust infrastructure.
- **Trust registry scenarios**: Define how trusted lists, trust anchors, trust levels and trust chains are created, evaluated, maintained and revoked.
- **Input to other tasks**: These use cases provide requirements for the Trust Framework (Task 2), PKI and trusted lists (Task 3), APIs (Task 4), certificate and policy models (Task 5), conformance/interop (Task 6) and testing (Task 7).
