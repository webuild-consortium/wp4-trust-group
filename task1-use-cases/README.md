# Task 1: Use Cases

This task focuses on defining comprehensive use cases for the WP4 Trust Infrastructure, covering onboarding scenarios and trust registry operations.

## Use Cases Definitions

All the use cases described for trust evaluation integration among participants in the Wallet ecosystem occur as distinct moments, entirely separate from the protocol exchange flows. Trust evaluation is conducted both prior to any interaction, at the initiation of these interactions and during the interactions. This proactive approach ensures protection for Users and organizations against any malicious behavior.

### Key Principles of Trust Evaluation Use Cases

1. **Proactive Trust Assessment**: Trust evaluation happens before any Wallet interaction begins, ensuring all participants are verified before data exchange occurs.

2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Trust status is continuously monitored and can be re-evaluated at any point during the interaction lifecycle.

3. **Risk-Based Decision Making**: Trust levels are assessed based on multiple factors including certificate validity, policy compliance, historical behavior, and risk indicators.

4. **Real-Time Validation**: Trust evaluation provides real-time decisions to enable or prevent interactions based on current trust status.

5. **Audit Trail**: All trust evaluation decisions are logged and auditable for compliance and forensic purposes.

### Trust Evaluation Context

Trust evaluation in the Wallet ecosystem serves as a critical security layer that operates independently of the main protocol flows. This separation ensures that:

- **Security is not compromised** by protocol complexity
- **Performance is optimized** through dedicated trust evaluation services
- **Scalability is maintained** through specialized trust infrastructure
- **Compliance is ensured** through dedicated audit and monitoring capabilities
