## Basic Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC-01
- **Title**: Relying Party Onboarding
- **Category**: Onboarding
- **Priority**: [High | Medium | Low]
- **Complexity**: [Simple | Medium | Complex]
- **Version**: 1.1
- **Last Updated**: 22/10/2025

## Actors
- **Primary Actor**: Relying Party
- **Secondary Actors**: Registrar, Access Certificate Authority, Provider of Registration Certificate

## Goal
- **Business Goal**: To register Relying Parties that intend to rely on European Digital Identity Wallets (EUDI Wallets) for the provision of digital public or private services (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2025/848, Recital 1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500848))
- **Technical Goal**: To establish a harmonised, secure, and interoperable framework for the registration, certification, and lifecycle management of Relying Parties, enabling trusted interaction between EUDI Wallet Solutions and other parties involved.
- **Success Criteria**:
    - *Interoperability across Member States*
        - All Relying Party Access and Registration Certificates are syntactically and semantically harmonised in line with version 1.4.1 (2023-10) and related IETF RFCs (7519, 8392, 9162).
        - Certificates and registration data can be validated cross-border in an automated manner.
    - *Secure trust establishment*
        - Each Relying Party’s identity and attributes are verifiable via National Registers and anchored in the EU trust framework (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, Article 5a(18)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj)).
        - Continuous monitoring and automatic Access and Registration Certificate revocation mechanisms are implemented and effective within 24 hours of a change request (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2025/848, Article 9(5)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500848)).
    - *Transparency and traceability*
        - All Certificate issuances, renewals, and revocations are logged (optionally under RFC 9162 – Certificate Transparency v2.0) and made publicly accessible for validation (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2025/848, Annex IV 3(j), Anenx V 3(i)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500848)).
        - Revocation and validity information is provided freely (free of charge), automatically, and reliably (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2025/848, Annex IV 5, Anenx V 6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500848)).
    - *Compliance and accountability*
        - Certificate Policies (CP) and Certification Practice Statements (CPS) follow ETSI EN 319 411-1 version 1.4.1 (2023-10) NCP requirements (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2025/848, Annex IV 3, Anenx V 3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500848)).
        - Each Member State designates at least one Registrar and maintains at least one National Register and communicates changes to the Commission and other Member States (ref. [Regulation (EU) 2025/848, Article 3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500848)).
    - *Operational effectiveness*
        - Onboarding of new Relying Parties is completed through a dual-phase process (administrative + technical) with measurable outcomes and turnaround times.
        - End-to-end validation of Access and Registration Certificates succeeds automatically through Trusted List integration, with the exception of Relying Parties that do not have a Union Trusted List.

Once the Access and Registration Certificates are active, the Relying Party may start offering its registered services to EUDI Wallet Users. It must keep its registration information up to date and comply with certification and revocation policies. Any suspension, cancellation, or change in the Relying Party’s status or intended use - whether initiated by the Registrar, another competent authority, or the Relying Party itself - triggers the update or revocation of its certificates and registry data in line with EU harmonised procedures.

*Preconditions:*
- **Prerequisites**: 
    - The Registration Policy, Access / Registration Certificate Policy and Practice Statement are defined and published at national level and harmonised accross the Union so that continuous monitoring mechanisms and revocation procedures are in place.
- **Triggers**: 
    - Change in the Relying Party’s registration data (e.g. legal status or intended use);
    - Automated detection of inconsistency or invalid data during monitoring by the Registrar or other competent authorities;
    - Notification from competent authorities (e.g. Supervisory Body, Data Protection Authority, Access Certificate Authority, Provider of Registration Certificate) regarding the need for registration or certificates suspension / cancellation / revocation.

*Postconditions:*
- **Success**: 
    - The Relying Party updates the existing registration (possibly through automated means) and mantains valid certificates aligned with registry information;
    - The Registrar informs the Access Certificate Authority, the Provider of Registration Certificate and the affected Relying Party about the Relying Party suspension or cancellation without undue delay (≤ 24 hours after the event);
    - The issued Access / Registration Certificate are revoked according to the certificate policy and the certificate practice statement (e.g. when the content of the certificate is no longer accurate and consistent with the information registered, or when the registration of the Relying Party is modified, suspended or cancelled);
    - Updates on Access / Registration Certificates revocation are processed automatically and published within prescribed timeframes (e.g. ≤ 24 hours after request).
- **Failure**: 
    - The competent autorities do not properly follow the defined measures and processes on certificates revocation.
- **Outputs**:
    - Updated and published certificate status and revocation information;
    - Audit logs and monitoring records for compliance verification;
    - Notifications to the Relying Party and other interested parties of any registration or certificates status change.
