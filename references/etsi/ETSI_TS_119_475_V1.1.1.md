## Introduction

The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1] establishes the legal framework for electronic identification and trust services within the internal market, including the provision and use of the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW). In this context, entities acting as wallet-relying parties are required to be registered by a Member State and to interact with the EUDIW using verifiable credentials. Commission Implementing Regulation (CIR) (EU) 2025/848 [i.2] further specifies the technical and procedural requirements for such interactions, including the use of wallet-relying party access certificates and, where applicable, registration certificates.

Wallet-relying party access certificates, issued by authorized certificate providers under Member State supervision, enable authentication of relying parties by the wallet, ensuring that only registered entities may interact with the EUDIW. Policy requirements for providers of wallet-relying party access certificates are outside of the scope of the present document. Where implemented, registration certificates provide structured, machine-readable information about the relying party's declared purposes, applicable entitlements, and authorized data requests.

Together, these certificates support user transparency, attribute minimization, and secure data handling by allowing the EUDIW to evaluate whether requests are consistent with the relying party's authorized scope and role.

---

## 1 Scope

The present document specifies requirements for the use of certificate-based attestations that support the identification and authorization of wallet-relying parties when interacting with the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW), in accordance with eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.1], and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/848 [i.2].

Specifically, the present document defines:

1. policy and profile requirements for wallet-relying party registration certificates used to convey the authorizations, entitlements, and intended purposes of wallet-relying parties, as well as the types of attributes they are authorized to request from wallet users;

2. guidance for the inclusion and mapping of wallet-relying party information, such as entitlements, identifiers in both certificates;

3. recommendations for coordination between providers of WRPRC and WRPAC.

The present document does not define requirements for the design, implementation, or internal operation of the European Digital Identity Wallet itself.

## 4 General concepts

### 4.1 Wallet-Relying Parties Certificates

The following types of certificates are defined in CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2]:

- **Wallet-Relying Party Access Certificates (WRPACs):** These certificates are issued by authorized certificate providers exclusively to WRPs registered in a national register, in compliance with Article 7 and Annex IV of CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2]. They are used for authenticating the WRP when interacting with the EUDIW and support electronic signature or electronic seal. WRPACs allow the EUDIW to verify the identity of the WRP, or an intermediary acting on behalf it, and ensure the authenticity and integrity of the request from the WRP, or intermediary, to the wallet.

> **NOTE 1:** In line with Annex IV of CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2], access certificates include specific identification and contact information of the WRP and be subject to continuous monitoring, validation, and revocation procedures.
> **NOTE 2:** Policy requirements for providers of WRPACs are defined in the ETSI TS 119 411-8 [17].

- **Wallet-Relying Party Registration Certificates (WRPRCs):** Where implemented by a Member State under Article 8 of CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2], these certificates provide information from national register of wallet-relying parties including the intended use of the WRP and indication the attributes that the WRP intends to request from a wallet. They are designed to support transparency, attribute minimization, and user awareness.

> **NOTE 3:** Use of WRPRC together with WRPAC secures privacy and supports user awareness.

Additionally, **Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs)** may be used to express additional attribute information about the WRP.

### 4.2 Wallet-Relying party roles

The classification of WRPs into distinct roles is essential to ensure the secure and transparent functioning of the EUDIW. These roles support authorization to specific functions and may enable the EUDIW to inform users about the regulatory status and entitlements of WRPs during interactions.

The following entitlements are defined at European Union level:

| Entitlement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Service_Provider** | General service provider |
| **QEAA_Provider** | Qualified trust service provider issuing qualified electronic attestations of attributes |
| **Non_Q_EAA_Provider** | Trust service provider issuing non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes |
| **PUB_EAA_Provider** | Public sector body or its agent issuing electronic attestations of attributes from authentic sources |
| **PID_Provider** | Provider of person identification data |
| **QCert_for_ESeal_Provider** | QTSP issuing qualified certificates for electronic seals |
| **QCert_for_ESig_Provider** | QTSP issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures |
| **rQSealCDs_Provider** | QTSP managing remote qualified electronic seal creation devices |
| **rQSigCDs_Provider** | QTSP managing remote qualified electronic signature creation devices |
| **ESig_ESeal_Creation_Provider** | Non-qualified provider for remote signature/seal creation |

> **NOTE:** Annex A provides OID numbers and URI for presented entitlements.

### 4.3 Wallet-Relying Party Access Certificates (WRPACs)

WRPACs are digital certificates used by registered WRP, or an intermediary acting on its behalf WRP, to authenticate themselves to the EUDIW. Their primary function is to ensure that any request for data or attributes sent to the EUDIW originates from a legitimate, authorized party listed in a national register of WRPs.

WRPACs are issued by entities designated as providers of wallet-relying party access certificates under the authorization of a Member State.

The present document does not define the policy and security requirements resulting from paragraph 3 of Annex IV of CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2]; those requirements are specified in ETSI TS 119 411-8 [17]. Clause 5.1 of the present document specifies mapping serving to both providers of WRPAC and WRPRC for coordination.

### 4.4 Wallet-Relying Party Registration Certificates (WRPRCs)

WRPRCs are structured data objects that describe the intended use and attribute access scope of a WRP registered in a national register. They serve as a transparency mechanism, enabling wallet users to understand what information a WRP is allowed to request and under which legal or functional entitlement.

In accordance with Article 8 of the CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2], Member States may mandate or allow the issuance of WRPRC by authorized providers of wallet-relying party registration certificates.

A WRPRC is formatted as signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [6] or CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) [7] and complies with the syntactic and semantic requirements specified in Annex V of CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2]. Both tokens have to be signed with an Advanced Electronic Signature (ADES) with the B-B profile.

### 4.5 Registration and access certificate relation

WRPRC and WRPAC serve distinct but complementary purposes within the EUDIW ecosystem. While the WRPAC ensures WRP authentication, the WRPRC conveys the WRP's declared use cases and data access policies to both the EUDIW and the end user. Together, they form a dual-layer trust framework, where the WRPAC guarantees the WRP's identity and authentication, and the WRPRC ensures entitlements, transparency and data minimization.

WRPACs and WRPRCs are technically and logically linked through the identity of the WRP. The key data enabling this link is the WRP identifier, which serves as the primary element for associating both certificates.

### 4.6 Certificate issuance

#### 4.6.1 General provisions

Each Member State establishes and maintains at least one national register of wallet-relying parties. This register contains information on entities established within the Member State that are authorized to interact with EUDIWs.

Each Member State designates at least one registrar of wallet-relying parties responsible for managing the national register.

Each Member State authorizes at least one provider of Wallet-Relying Party Access Certificates (Certificate Authority) to issue and manage WRPAC.

Member States may also authorize one or more provider of Wallet-Relying Party Registration Certificates to issue and manage WRPRC.

#### 4.6.2 WRPAC and WRPRC policies

Policy requirements for providers of wallet-relying party access certificates are defined in ETSI TS 119 411-8 [17].

Policy requirements for providers of wallet-relying party registration certificates are defined in clause 6.

#### 4.6.3 Identity proofing of WRPs

Before a WRP is registered in the national register of WRPs, the registrar carries out identity proofing in accordance with Article 6 of CIR (EU) 2025/848 [i.2]. This may be performed either directly by the registrar or by authorized entities acting on its behalf, and follows the requirements set out in ETSI TS 119 461 [i.11].

## Annex D (informative): WRP registration use cases

### D.1 Use case 1: Integrated model

In this model, the registrar and certificate provider are the same entity. The registration and issuance processes are tightly coupled and managed under a single authority.

### D.2 Use case 2: Registrar-initiated issuance

In this model, the registrar completes the registration and then initiates the certificate issuance by instructing a designated certificate provider. The WRP does not need to interact directly with the provider.

### D.3 Use case 3: RP-initiated issuance post-registration

In this model, the registrar performs the registration, and later the relying party contacts a certificate provider to request issuance. The provider is responsible for verifying that the relying party is listed in the national register.

### D.4 Use case 4: Provider-assisted registration
