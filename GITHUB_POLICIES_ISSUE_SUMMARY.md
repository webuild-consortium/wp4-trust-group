# GitHub Issue Summary: Policy Approaches Definition

## Issue Title
`[POLICY] Define Additive and Subtractive Policy Approaches for Trust Framework`

## Issue Description

### Problem Statement
The WP4 Trust Infrastructure framework currently lacks clear definitions and implementation guidelines for different policy approaches. We need to establish two distinct policy methodologies that align with zero-trust principles and provide flexible policy management for both Credential Issuers and Relying Parties.

### Proposed Solution
Define and implement:

1. **Additive Policy Approach**: Explicit allow-list model (zero-trust principle)
   - "Nothing is permitted unless explicitly allowed"
   - Default deny with explicit allow rules
   - Suitable for high-security environments

2. **Subtractive Policy Approach**: Explicit deny-list model (permissive principle)
   - "Everything is permitted unless explicitly denied"
   - Default allow with explicit deny rules
   - Suitable for open ecosystems and development

### Key Features
- **Dual Application**: Both approaches apply to Credential Issuers and Relying Parties
- **OpenID Federation Integration**: Trust mark schemas for policy communication
- **Comprehensive Classification**: Attribute and credential classification by scope/purpose
- **Security Alignment**: Additive approach aligns with zero-trust principles
- **Flexibility**: Subtractive approach provides operational flexibility

### Implementation Scope
- Policy data models for both approaches
- OpenID Federation trust mark schemas
- Attribute and credential classification system
- Policy evaluation algorithms
- API endpoints for policy management
- Security and compliance considerations

### Expected Outcomes
- Clear policy approach definitions
- Standardized trust mark schemas
- Comprehensive attribute/credential classification
- Implementation guidelines and examples
- Security and compliance framework

## Priority
High - This is foundational for the trust framework implementation

## Estimated Effort
8-10 weeks (2 weeks per phase)

## Dependencies
- Task 2: Trust Framework (policy framework foundation)
- Task 5: Participants' Certificates and Policies (data models)
- Task 4: Trust Infrastructure API (API implementation)
