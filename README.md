# WP4 Trust Group

Public resources shared within the WE BUILD WP4 Trust Infrastructure group

The Trust Registry Infrastructure group is dedicated to establishing the framework for trust evaluation and management within digital wallet ecosystems, in compliance but not limited to the model defined by European regulation (910/2014 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1183).  

The group develops an implementation of the trust model based on a trusted third party (Trusted Lists) resulting in a Trust Framework and an demo infrastructure of trust. 

The group aims to create a comprehensive infrastructure of trust that supports seamless interactions among diverse entities.
