# Requirements Matrix: Trusted Lists, Participant Registration, and Trust Evaluation

This matrix extracts all requirements related to trusted lists, participant registration, and trust evaluation from Annex 2 (High-Level Requirements) of the [EUDI Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework version 2.8.0](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/v2.8.0/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.01-high-level-requirements.md) (ARF v2.8.0). This repository aligns with ARF v2.8.0; ARF v2.7.3 is no longer referenced.

**Terminology (ARF v2.8.0):** Where validation/consumption of trust anchors is described (e.g. OIA_12, RPA_04), the ARF uses **LoTE** (List of Trusted Entities). Publication artifacts may still be referred to as Trusted Lists (TL) where aligned with ETSI/eIDAS.
